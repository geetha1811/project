I understand your frustration, and I’m here to help. Let’s go through the issue clearly and implement a step-by-step solution to ensure the required behavior is achieved.


---

Recap of the Problem:

1. When a criteria is selected from the dropdown and details are provided, it works fine.


2. When you try to add a new criteria or return to the dropdown, the previously selected criteria and its details still show up. This should not happen.




---

What Needs to Happen:

When you delete a criterion using criteriaDelete, all the details related to that criterion (like inputs and suggestions) must be cleared.

The interface should be reset properly to ensure old data is not lingering when switching between searches.



---

Final Modified criteriaDelete Method:

Here’s how you can modify the criteriaDelete method to fully address the problem:

criteriaDelete(index, event) {
    // Check if the index is valid
    if (index >= 0 && index < this.addCritInputs.length) {
        // Remove the selected criterion from the list
        this.addCritInputs.splice(index, 1);
    }

    // Clear the extra fields related to the deleted criterion
    if (index >= 0 && index < this.extraFields.length) {
        this.extraFields.splice(index, 1);
    }

    // Reset selected header, value, and search-related data
    this.selectedHeader = '';
    this.selectedValue = '';
    this.searchName = '';

    // Call loadSuggestions to refresh the dropdown or UI
    this.loadSuggestions();
}


---

Ensure It’s Integrated Properly:

Add the Following Steps to Your Workflow:

1. Reset on Dropdown Change:
In the addCriteriaChange method, reset any fields before loading new suggestions:

addCriteriaChange(event) {
    if (typeof event !== 'undefined' && event !== '') {
        // Clear any previous inputs or suggestions
        this.extraFields = [];
        this.selectedHeader = '';
        this.selectedValue = '';
        this.searchName = '';

        // Add the new criterion
        this.addCritInputs.push({ value: event });

        // Load new suggestions
        this.loadSuggestions();
    }
}


2. Clear All Data After Search:
Once a search is completed, clear all fields using:

clearAllCriteria() {
    this.extraFields = [];
    this.addCritInputs = [];
    this.selectedHeader = '';
    this.selectedValue = '';
}

performSearch() {
    // Perform the search logic
    // ...

    // Clear criteria after search is done
    this.clearAllCriteria();
}

Testing Checklist:

1. When Adding a New Criterion:

Dropdown selections should allow you to add new inputs without showing old ones.



2. When Deleting a Criterion:

The selected criteria and associated details should be cleared.



3. After Performing a Search:

All inputs and selected criteria should reset for a fresh start.
