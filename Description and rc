The issue arises because you are comparing the id of the options with the value of this.rc, which may not be set properly. Here's how to address the problem:

Updated Code

TypeScript Code

onDropdownChange(selectedId: string): void {
  console.log('Selected ID:', selectedId);

  // Find the selected option by matching the ID
  const selectedOption = this.dropdownOptions.find(option => option.id === selectedId);

  if (selectedOption) {
    // Update the selected description with the matched option's description
    this.selectedDescription = selectedOption.description;
    console.log('Selected Option:', selectedOption);
  } else {
    console.log('No option found for the selected ID');
    this.selectedDescription = ''; // Reset if no option is found
  }

  // If `this.rc` needs to be handled, ensure it is updated properly
  if (this.rc) {
    const rcOption = this.dropdownOptions.find(option => option.id === this.rc);
    if (rcOption) {
      console.log('Option matched with rc:', rcOption);
    } else {
      console.log('No option matched with rc');
    }
  }
}

Whatâ€™s Fixed?

1. selectedId Matching:

The description updates correctly by matching the selected dropdown value (selectedId) with the id of options in dropdownOptions.



2. this.rc Handling:

Additional logic ensures this.rc is processed separately if needed.

How to Ensure It Works

1. Make sure this.rc is set properly before the dropdown is interacted with.


2. If you need both selectedId and this.rc to work independently, keep their logic separate.




---

Explanation

When you select a dropdown option, the onDropdownChange function updates the selectedDescription based on the selectedId.

If this.rc is used for another operation, it's handled separately so that it does not interfere with the dropdown logic.

Debugging Steps

1. Add these logs for debugging:

console.log('Dropdown Options:', this.dropdownOptions);
console.log('Selected ID:', selectedId);
console.log('RC ID:', this.rc);
console.log('Selected Description:', this.selectedDescription);


2. Ensure dropdownOptions is populated and this.rc has a valid value.
