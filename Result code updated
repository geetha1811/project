Based on the screenshots and information shared, it seems the output is being added twice to the HeaderSet or ResultSet. This issue might occur due to the following reasons:

1. Duplicate Data in the ResultSet:

The stored procedure itself might be returning duplicate rows in either the HeaderSet or ResultSet.



2. Improper Loop Execution:

If ResultSet or HeaderSet logic is being processed twice inadvertently, it can result in duplicates being added to the list.




Steps to Debug:

1. Check Stored Procedure:

Validate if the stored procedure is returning duplicate rows for the HeaderSet and ResultSet.



2. Debug the Code:

Add logging statements right before adding data to HeaderSet and ResultSet to inspect what is being added and how many times the loop runs.


Example:

public void setHeaderSet(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    while (rs.next()) {
        String columnName = rs.getString(columnIndex: 1);
        HeaderSet.add(columnName);
        log.info("Adding column to HeaderSet: " + columnName);
    }
}

public void setResultSet(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    while (rs.next()) {
        List<String> row = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= rs.getMetaData().getColumnCount(); i++) {
            row.add(rs.getString(i));
        }
        ResultSet.add(row.toString());
        log.info("Adding row to ResultSet: " + row);
    }
}



Fixing the Issue:

If duplicates are confirmed, ensure the loops or logic aren't being invoked multiple times. Check:

Single Execution of Methods:

Ensure setHeaderSet and setResultSet methods are being called only once for each ResultSet.



Expected Swagger Output:

For your code, the Swagger response should look like this:

{
  "HeaderSet": ["column1", "column2", "column3"],
  "ResultSet": [
    ["data1", "data2", "data3"],
    ["data4", "data5", "data6"]
  ],
  "OutStatus": "SUCCESS"
}

If duplicates are removed, you will not see duplicate rows or columns in HeaderSet and ResultSet. Let me know if you need help debugging further!
