Yes, you can use a POST method for your request while ensuring it does not add or modify data in the database. Using POST doesn't inherently mean data will be inserted or updated; it depends on how your backend logic is written.


---

Explanation:

1. Using POST Instead of GET:

A POST method can be used to send the data in the request body instead of the URL.

This approach avoids issues with long URLs and optional path parameters, as all data can be sent in the request body.



2. Fetching Data with POST:

A POST method can be used solely for retrieving data from the database without modifying it.

It depends on how the backend service (controller and service layers) is implemented. If the logic only queries the database and returns results, no data will be inserted or updated.



3. Will POST Add Data to the Database?

No, unless you explicitly write logic to insert data in your service or repository layer. A typical SELECT query in the backend will not perform any modifications to the database.

Modified Controller with POST:

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the POST method to fetch data:

Controller Code:

@PostMapping(
    path = "result",
    produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE
)
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('api.iris-portal-basic-details.vl1')")
@Operation(
    method = "POST",
    summary = "Get Breakdown Result",
    description = "Fetch Breakdown Result based on input parameters"
)
@ApiResponses({
    @ApiResponse(
        responseCode = "200",
        description = "Breakdown Result fetched successfully",
        content = @Content(mediaType = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    ),
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "400", description = "Invalid Request Data"),
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "401", description = "Unauthorized")
})
public ResponseEntity<BreakdownResult> getBreakdownResult(
    @RequestBody BreakdownRequest request
) throws Exception {
    // Handle null or empty businessDate2
    String businessDate2 = request.getBusinessDate2();
    if (businessDate2 == null || "null".equalsIgnoreCase(businessDate2) || businessDate2.isEmpty()) {
        businessDate2 = ""; // Default to empty string
    }

    // Call service layer with request parameters
    BreakdownResult result = breakdownService.getBreakdownResult(
        request.getBasicId(),
        request.getBusinessDate1(),
        businessDate2,
        request.getRc()
    );

    return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
}

Request DTO:

public class BreakdownRequest {
    private String basicId;
    private String businessDate1;
    private String businessDate2; // Optional
    private String rc;

    // Getters and Setters
}


---

Frontend Service for POST:

getBreakdownResult(requestBody: {
  basicId: string;
  businessDate1: string;
  businessDate2?: string;
  rc: string;
}): Observable<any> {
  console.log('Request Body:', requestBody);

  // Call the POST endpoint with requestBody
  return this.http
    .post(environment.gatewayURL + 'rest/breakDown/result', requestBody, this.authService.authHeaderOptions())
    .pipe(
      map(this.responseData),
      catchError((error: Response) => {
        console.error('Error occurred while fetching Breakdown Result:', error);

        // Show error message
        this.toastr.errorToastr(
          'Error occurred while fetching Breakdown Result',
          'Breakdown',
          {
            toastTimeout: 3000,
            position: 'bottom-right',
            showCloseButton: true,
          }
        );

        // Throw error for further handling
        return throwError('Something went wrong');
      })
    );
}

Example Usage:

1. With businessDate2:

this.getBreakdownResult({
  basicId: '123',
  businessDate1: '2025-01-01',
  businessDate2















To test this with Swagger using a POST request and handle the businessDate2 parameter (with or without), here's how you can proceed:


---

Steps for Testing in Swagger:

1. Swagger Documentation for POST:

Assuming your Swagger documentation is set up properly, the POST endpoint should be visible under the specified path, such as /rest/breakDown/result.



2. Request Body:

Since you're using POST, Swagger will provide an input field for the request body in JSON format.

You can provide the required parameters as a JSON object (with or without businessDate2).




Example Request Body in Swagger:

{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "businessDate2": "2025-01-15",
  "rc": "456"
}

If businessDate2 is provided in the body, Swagger will pass it as "2025-01-15".

If businessDate2 is not provided, the backend will interpret it as null or an empty string, depending on your logic.


Example without businessDate2:

{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "rc": "456"
}

In this case, businessDate2 will be handled as an empty string ("") by the backend based on your logic.



---

Expected URL with POST Request:

Since you're using a POST method, the URL will always be the same (without the path variables):

POST /rest/breakDown/result

Swagger will show this endpoint as the target for your POST request. The parameters will be passed as part of the request body rather than as URL parameters.

With businessDate2: The JSON body you send in the request would look like:

{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "businessDate2": "2025-01-15",
  "rc": "456"
}

This sends a request to the backend where businessDate2 is "2025-01-15".

Without businessDate2 (Empty string):

{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "rc": "456"
}

In this case, the backend would interpret businessDate2 as an empty string "".



---

How Swagger Handles Optional Parameters:

If you mark businessDate2 as optional in the request body, Swagger will allow you to omit it.

With businessDate2:

{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "businessDate2": "2025-01-15",
  "rc": "456"
}

Without businessDate2 (Optional, backend should interpret as empty):

{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "rc": "456"
}




---

What Happens When You Send the Request:

If you send the POST request with businessDate2, the backend will receive the data, query the database with the provided values, and return the result.

If you send the POST request without businessDate2 (or with null), the backend will treat it as an empty string, and the service will fetch the result accordingly.



---

Swagger URL Behavior:

With the POST method, you will not see path variables in the URL like you would in a GET request. Instead, you send the data as part of the request body, so the URL will remain:

POST /rest/breakDown/result

The actual data is included in the body of the request, not in the URL.


---

Example:

1. With businessDate2 in Swagger:

Swagger will show the request body with businessDate2 included, such as:


{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "businessDate2": "2025-01-15",
  "rc": "456"
}

The URL will remain:

POST /rest/breakDown/result



2. Without businessDate2 (Optional):

You can omit businessDate2 in the request body, like so:


{
  "basicId": "123",
  "businessDate1": "2025-01-01",
  "rc": "456"
}

Again, the URL remains:

POST /rest/breakDown/result
